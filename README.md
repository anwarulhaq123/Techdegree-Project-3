1.“Focus” State. // My objective in this section was making the focus of the cursor in the “Name” field When page Load. I achieved this objective by utilising the  focus()// Method.

2. Add an ‘Other’ Option//  "Your job role" text field appears when user selects "Other" from the Job Role menu. I achieved this objective by targeting the element Id and Use the “hide().” and “show().” Method utilizing the jQuery  .
3. T-Shirt Section// The goal for the t-shirt section is to filter the available "Color" options by the selected theme in the "Design" field. Doing this ensures that the user cannot select an invalid combination of values for the "Design" and "Color" fields.// To achieve my required goal in this section I utilize the jQuery and use the “val().”; “show().” And “html().”Methods.

4. Activity Section// My goal in this section was making sure as the user choose the activity show the cost  of the activity and also make sure the activities  not conflict ,when user make the multiple checks and show the total cost of activities. // I achieved this goal by utilizing the jQuery .I use the Array , if , else and typeof ().method to complete this section.

5. Payment Section.// The user should be able to change payment options at anytime, but shouldn’t be able to select the “Select Payment Method” option. So you’ll need to check the currently selected payment option, and hide and show the payment sections in the form accordingly.// show(). And hide(). Methods used to complete the section.

6. Form Validation and validation Message.// I have completed this section by using “Regex” ,changing elements style and properties, and use the PreventDefault(). With the main submission button.
